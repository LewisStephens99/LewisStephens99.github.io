											<h2>About Me</h2>
										</header>
										<p>I am a passionate developer who has recently graduated from Nottingham Trent University with a 2nd Class Honours 1st Division in Software Engineering. While I am proficient in many of the most commonly used languages such as C++, C#, Java and Python. I have experience in many different areas including Web App Development, Mobile App Development and Database Engineering that I learnt throughout my degree. I am looking for a graduate job in Software Development, Software Engineering, Web Development or Mobile Development.</p>
										<p>I realised I would love Programming from a young age when tackling challenges that required me to problem solve such as troubleshooting problems with computers or any device in my home. I am always looking to learn new things and have practiced working well with others in module scenarios at University to achieve a fully fledged application that works well and is matched to the requirements of the client.</p>

									<h2>Experience and Interests</h2>

								<ul class="features">

										<span class="icon solid major style1 fa-code"></span>
										<h3>Types of Development</h3>
										<p>Software Engineering - One of my favourite languages through university was C++ and one of my first projects after Python was with C++ creating a Mortgage Calculator Program.</p>
										<p>Websites - As a part of my degree I had to create multiple types of Websites and Web Applications. Coding Languages that were used for these projects include C#, HTML, JavaScript and CSS. </p>
										<p>Mobile Applications - One of my modules included creating a mobile application on the Android Studio IDE. The Application created was an Finance application that helped Students with managing their finances efficiently, as well as this it allowed advertisers to post job adverts on the app for the student to see and apply to.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="icon solid major style3 fa-tasks"></span>
										<h3>Recent Projects</h3>
										<p>React Native - Since finishing University I have been learning React Native to create an iOS application.</p>
										<p>Audio-Visualisation Sensory Stimulation Program for Children with ASD - created using C++ and OpenGL and a toolkit known as openFrameworks that made use of detecting audio input from a microphone</p>
										<p>Website Application for a Inventory System - for a University tasks I was assigned with a group to design a brand new Inventory System for a shop at the University, this led to the idea to use Python Flask, HTML, JavaScript and SQL. We also used Amazon Web Services to host the database in testing and designing the application. It was a big learning curve for me and introduced me to many techniques used in businesses such as Agile.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="icon major style5 fa-gem"></span>
										<h3>Personal Interests</h3>
										<p>Hardware and Technology - I enjoy anything to do with these topics. At a young age I would open up devices to look at the hardware and enjoyed the problem solving of putting it back together, I think this got me into Programming in the first place.</p>
										<p>Motorsports - I love to watch any sort of motorsport events across the world and have attended many around the country. Taking this interest across to technology I can own meant I gained an interest in Simracing and RC Cars.</p>
										<p>Music - As most of my time is spent programming, it gives me a chance to listen to many different albums and songs which has constantly diversified my taste in music, leading to an interest in collecting Vinyl Records and DJing. </p>
